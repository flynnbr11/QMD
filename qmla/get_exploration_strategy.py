    Get an instance of the class specified by the user which implements an exploration Strategy.

    Instance of a :class:`~qmla.ExplorationStrategy` (or subclass).
    This is used to specify how QMLA proceeds, in particular by designing the next batch
    of models to test.
    Exploration Strategy is specified by the name passed to implement_qmla in the launch script,
    through the command line flag `exploration_strategy`. This string is searched for in the
    exploration_classes dictionary. New exploration strategies must be added here so that QMLA can find them.
