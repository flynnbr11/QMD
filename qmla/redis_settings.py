r"""
Create multiple databases on a redis server.

Redis connections require a port number and host server.
Each QMLA instance has a unique port number (though can share hosts).
These are determined by the launch script,
either local_launch.sh or parallel_launch.sh.
By calling get_redis_databases_by_qmla_id, a set of database
addresses unique to that qmla_id (host/port) are returned in a dictionary.
These can be used to store information required by distinct actors
to perform QMLA, without requiring all information be held on all actors
at all times.
This method is quite slow - useful information is stored in dictionaries and
pickled to redis. Pickling and unpickling is quite slow, so should be minimised.

    * The first available ``db`` is 6, such that ``qmla_id=2`` will not interfere with
      the databases of ``qmla_id=1``.
