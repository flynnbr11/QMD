def process_basic_operator(basic_operator):

    Transform a string, representing a term in the model, into a matrix.

    Physical systems have different corresponding string processing functions.
    These are provided in the dictionary `qmla.process_string_to_matrix.string_processing_functions`.
    There are a number of rules which model strings must obey to be processed properly.
        * Terms are separated by ``+``.
        * Within terms, components are separated by ``_``.
        * Components have different meanings, depending on which string
          processing function is used.
        * The first component is the `indicator` of which processing function to use;
          it is matched with a processing function in `~qmla.string_processing_functions`.
        * The final component in general indicates the dimension  ``N`` of the system,
          and is specified by ``dN``.
        * No other component should start with ``d``, as it uniquely indicates the dimension.
        * Alternatively, core operators can be processed alone,
          these are given in :attr:`~qmla.core_operator_dict`.
    For example, the string ``pauliSet_1J2_xJx_d3+pauliSet_1J3_zJz_d3``:
        * Terms: ``pauliSet_1J2_xJx_d3``, ``pauliSet_1J3_zJz_d3``
        * Components (of ``pauliSet_1J2_xJx_d3``): ``pauliSet``, ``1J2``, ``xJx``, ``d3``
        * Indicator ``pauliSet`` tells it to process via :meth:`~qmla.process_multipauli_term`.
        * ``d3`` tells it to use a 3 qubit basis
        * Other components are interpreted by the string processing function
        * In this case, the result is the matrix ( XXI + ZIZ) .

    :param str basic_operator: term to generate matrix from.
    :return np.ndarray mtx: matrix corresponding to the input term.
